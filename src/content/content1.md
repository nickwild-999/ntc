##About Us
I have been a professional casting director for almost 20 years and worked with some amazingly talented actors, directors and producers and some wonderful agents in Film, Commercials and TV.

I am passionate about my job and I am committed to delivering casting services of the highest possible level whether you are producing a short film, TV series or a global advertising campaign for an iconic fashion brand. I have been lucky enough to be nominated for a British Arrows award in 2015 and was one of the D&AD judges in 2017

I have offices in London, Manchester and Huddersfield, but I also regularly cast projects in the USA and Europe. Please check out a small selection of the projects I have worked on below.

I would love to help you cast your next project please get in touch!
