# Gatsby v2 WordPress Starter

This starter is forked from the
[gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
and modified to use WordPress instead of netlify-cms.

Demo: https://gatsby-starter-wordpress.netlify.com/

> **WARNING**: Using `yarn upgrade` or `npm update` will break the site. See [GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress#36](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/issues/36) and [gatsbyjs/gatsby#10262](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/10262) for more info. Hopefully we'll have a resolution soon. - 19 Dec 2018
